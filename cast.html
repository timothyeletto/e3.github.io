      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6">

Timothy is an actor and pretty much everything else for E3
Productions. He was the one that started the YouTube channel and
the entire company. He is an Actor, Writer, Editor, Producer,
and Director. You may be thinking, "If Timothy does all of that, why
doesn't anyone else help out and take some of those jobs?" The
reason that no one else takes any of Timothy's jobs is because Timothy
actually likes having all of these jobs because he likes having
a lot of control so he won't give anyone else and of his jobs.

        Gregory Eletto
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6">

Gregory is an actor and Graphic Designer for E3 Productions. This
means that he acts in the skits, and he makes any pictures that are
needed such as thumbnails and the picture on the about page. He
uses Photoshop CS6 to cut out pictures of the people in the skit and
put them onto one picture that looks good and grabs your eye. He is
also very often relied on to find people that we can use in skits and
other productions since he is a lot more social than Timothy.

        Rosie Eletto
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6">

Rosie is an actor and 2nd AC. This means that she acts in the skits,
and claps the production slate which is used to line up the video and
external audio while editing. She is also a grip which means that she
basically does anything that Timothy tells her to do and gets
anything that Timothy may need. The reason that this is so surprising
is because she's only 10 and she's the youngest out of all the cast and
crew. However, she actually volunteered to be the grip. She would
also have to get people involved with E3 Productions, like Gregory
does, but the only people that she knows are little kids and we can't
make little kids work for us without pay.

        Alexander Lubman
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6">

Alexander is just an actor for E3 Productions. He's really funny and a
good actor but he can't be in all of the skits because unlike the rest of
us, he doesn't live with us. He actually lives down the block from the
rest of us, which is good because he does come to our house a lot.
He really just makes the skits because we asked if he wanted to make
a skit one time and he just went with it. We're glad he did though
because it's nice to have that character that just goes along with
whatever everyone else does which actually isn't very far off from his
actual personality
